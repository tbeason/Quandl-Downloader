# Download Data for Multiple Stocks from Quandl

This program is pretty simple. Select up to 25 stocks that you want price and volume data for. Select the date ranges you wish to have (it will apply to all stocks). Choose your file options. Click **Download**. 

The files will be compressed in the .tar format, so you will need something like the freely-available [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract them.
