# Download Data for Multiple Stocks from Quandl

This program is pretty simple. Select up to 25 stocks that you want price and volume data for. Select the date ranges you wish to have (it will apply to all stocks). Choose your file options. Click **Download**. 

### To Open
The files will be compressed in the .tar.gz (.tgz) format, so you will need something like the freely-available [7-zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to extract them. Because of the compression process, you will need to do to 2 extractions to use the files. The individual files themselves will be saved in the .csv format, which can be opened by Excel or any text editor.

### About the Data
This data is pulled from Quandl's [Wiki End-of-Day](https://www.quandl.com/data/WIKI/documentation/documentation) Stock Prices API. While I consider it one of the most reliable free sources of this type of information, I cannot personally guarantee the accuracy of any of its information.
